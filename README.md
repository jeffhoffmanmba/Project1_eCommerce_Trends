# Project1_eCommerce_Trends

## Background
We will be analyzing E-Commerce sales trends over the past 10 years. We will investigate variances amongst the industries as well as demographics. Given the uniqueness of the worlds current state, we will look at the effects of Covid-19 on E-Commerce as it relates to the shut down and reopening of countries/states. We hope to gain valuable insight from both historical and present data to predict the future trend of E-Commerce.
